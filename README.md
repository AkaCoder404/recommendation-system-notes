# Recommendation System Notes

This is a collection of my notes for RS. Includes paper implementations, benchmarks, and more.

## Papers
Collection of papers
- Sichun Luo et. al., Aug 2022, HySAGE: A Hybrid Static and Adaptive Graph Embedding Network for Context-Drifting Recommendations - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09586

## Datasets
- Yelp (2018) Dataset - Task is to recmmend business webpages to users. 
- Amazon Kindle - Task is to recommend e-books to users.
- MovieLens 100K - Canonical movie recommendation dataset widely used for evaluating recommendation algoruthms
- Kaggle-Movie - 

### Preprocessing Tips
Different implementations (paper experiments) may have slightly different preprocessing steps (and perhaps slightly different results), thus it is important to note common preprocessing techniques.

## Experiments
Here I practice different implementations of popular RS algorithms and techniques.

```sh
knn-algo/        # Here is
